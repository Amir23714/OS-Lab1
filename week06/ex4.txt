The aim of the Round Robin algorithm is to minimize the average waiting time for processes.

Its effectiveness directly depends on a qualitatively selected QUANTUM.
Its advantage is that even long-term running processes will fairly receive their share of processor time.
However, there is also a drawback - due to the large amount of QUANTUM switching, short-term processes can take longer than usual.

Therefore, for example, if we choose QUANTUM to be very large, the processes will be executed simply in the order they arrive, without switching QUANTUM
Otherwise, each process will be executed in at least 1 run. I mean, when switching Quantum, each process (its chunks) can be executed several times
before its full completion
