Results are approximately the same. However, processes come in another order (short job first).
If there is longer job that can be executed immediately, and shorter job which will come in a few seconds, we execute longer one (I mean we are not waiting).
SJF aims to minimize the waiting time of processes in the queue, but overall time stays the same.
