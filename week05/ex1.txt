Why we need to create n named pipes for n subscribers? Answer: we need this, because we want each of them to have communication bus with publisher.

I found this exersise very interesting for me. It was hard to understand the task.
However, after that I understood how to create pipes and how two processes can communicate
with each other via them. Also it was interesting to write ex1.sh script. However,
I couldn't make loop in it :(
