Yes, monitor.c program reported an event for myfile11.txt. It happend because myfile11.txt is located in the directory viewed by the monitor.c program.

No, monitor.c program did not report an event for myfile13.txt. Changes in the original file (/tmp/myfile1.txt) do not lead to changes in symbolic link (myfile13.txt).
Since myfile13.txt just points to the path to the file, and does not share the inode with it (unlike hard links).

Number of hardlinks equals to one. Because we called function unlink_all, which deletes all hardlinks with the same inode.
However, there is also myfile13.txt, which is symboliclink.
